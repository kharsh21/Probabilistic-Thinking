# Probabilistic-Thinking
• Achieved primary skill in axiomatic probability theory, including probability spaces, conditional probability, Bayes’ rule, random
variables, expectation, combinatorics, and an efficient Dynamic programming approach for computing Catalan Numbers.

• Obtained an understanding of Stochastic processes as well as Markov Chains. Using techniques from Markov Chain Monte
Carlo (MCMC), we developed a Text-generation algorithm that was then trained on a collection of Shakespeare’s works.

• Developed and trained a Bayesian Machine Learning model on test data, attaining a high R-squared score of more than 0.9
for parameter determination. We found a variable that is uncorrelated with the others, as well as heteroskedasticity in the data.

• Gained knowledge in Randomized algorithms, including design techniques and mathematical tools for analysis such as Lin-
earity of Expectation and Chernoff ’s Bound. Applied these techniques to develop a simulated-annealing based 9x9 Sudoku
solver, capable of computing a correct solution from within a space of size ∼ 1026 in under 1 second
